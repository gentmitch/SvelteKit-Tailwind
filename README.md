# SvelteKit + Tailwindcss

Note: this is using pnpm.

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, with Tailwindcss.

## Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```
## Developing

Once pnpm is finished run a local server with

```bash
pnpm run dev
```
# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
```bash
pnpm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
